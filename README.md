# home-list

I use a new project with mock data for simplify the work, sorry for the inconvenience. This page show a list of house for holiday rent.

The full code is available at https://github.com/FranciscoJavierMartin/Home-holidays-mobile/

Subjects to considerer:
- The page is responsive.
- The design was done with mobile-first in mind
- The page count with three designs, one for mobile, one for tablets and the last for desktop.
- The links in the navbar are broken due to dont point to any site or page.
- The buttons show a message on browser console.
- I use sass
- The second image in the list is broken in order to show a fallback image when an online image is not available.
- The buttons count with a ripple effect.
- The links have the same ripple effect.
- If the description text is too long for a proper display, ellipsis points are added. This can be see specially on a mobile screen.
- This page use font-awesome for icons
